There is jupyter notebook file submitted in which 
there are a number of imports, feature selection 
techniques used and models implemented . Furthermore
we have used AdaBoost Classification technique which
is a set of simple and weak classifiers is used to 
achieve an improved classifier by emphasizing the 
samples that are misclassified by weak classifiers.
This is more or less the main flow used to achieve the
best possible score.Finally the code automatically 
generates a csv file with the required output.
